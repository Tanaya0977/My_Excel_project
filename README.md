Vrinda store annual report-2022
In the Vrinda Super Store 2022 project, I conducted meticulous data cleaning, processing, and analysis using MS Excel. 
Leveraging its powerful features, I created dynamic dashboards to visualize and dissect the profit and loss trends of the store throughout the year. 
My work contributed to informed decision-making, ultimately helping Vrinda Super Store optimize its financial performance in 2022.
